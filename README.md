# Water_Surface_Vehicle
The Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USV) or Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASV) are vessels that operates on the water surface without any crew. They can be remotely controlled via a wired connection or through various wireless technologies, or they could be fully autonomous that and follow programmed waypoints, while measuring sensor outputs along the tracks. Another option is to create a hybrid which can operate in either mode. In the last few years, a growing number of Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs) have been developed for environmental monitoring and robotic research applications. These have been used in particular in environmental monitoring.

Many ASVs are already available in the market which offer satisfactory services but these are quite expensive and unfeasible for inlet waters because of their large size and maintenance cost.

In this work we propose the design and control of an ASV which is intended to be used for monitoring lakes and other small water bodies. We start prototyping the remotely operated version and then slowly move on to autonomous control.
